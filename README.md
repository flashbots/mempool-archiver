Archiving mempool transactions in [Parquet](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format) and CSV format.

**The data is freely available at https://mempool-dumpster.flashbots.net**

Overview:

- Data is published under the [CC-0 public domain license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
- Saving about 1M - 2M unique transactions per day
- This project is under active development and the codebase might change significantly without notice. The functionality itself is pretty stable.

## Available mempool transaction sources

1. Generic EL nodes - go-ethereum, Infura, etc. (Websockets, using `newPendingTransactions`)
2. Alchemy (Websockets, using [`alchemy_pendingTransactions`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/alchemy-pendingtransactions), warning - burns a lot of credits)
3. [bloXroute](https://docs.bloxroute.com/streams/newtxs-and-pendingtxs) (Websockets and gRPC)
4. [Chainbound Fiber](https://fiber.chainbound.io/docs/usage/getting-started/) (gRPC)
5. [Eden](https://docs.edennetwork.io/eden-rpc/speed-rpc) (Websockets)

Note: Some sources send transactions that are already included on-chain, which are discarded (not added to archive or summary)

## FAQ

- _When is the data uploaded?_ ... The data for the previous day is uploaded daily between UTC 4am and 4:30am.
- _What are exclusive transactions?_ ... a transaction that was seen from no other source (transaction only provided by a single source). These transactions might include recycled transactions (which were already seen long ago but not included, and resent by a transaction source).
- _What does "XOF" stand for?_ ... XOF stands for "exclusive orderflow" (i.e. exclusive transactions).
- _What is a-pool?_ ... A-Pool is a regular geth node with some optimized peering settings, subscribed to over the network.
- _gRPC vs Websockets?_ ... bloXroute and Chainbound are connected with gRPC, all other sources are connected with Websockets (note that gRPC has a lower latency than WebSockets).

# Working with Parquet

[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is a column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk (more [here](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet#:~:text=What%20is%20Parquet%3F,handle%20complex%20data%20in%20bulk.)).

We recommend to use [ClickHouse local](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/utilities/clickhouse-local) (as well as [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)) to work with Parquet files, it makes it easy to run [queries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements) like:

```bash
# count rows
$ clickhouse local -q "SELECT count(*) FROM 'transactions.parquet' LIMIT 1;"

# get the first hash+rawTx
$ clickhouse local -q "SELECT hash,hex(rawTx) FROM 'transactions.parquet' LIMIT 1;"

# get details of a particular hash
$ clickhouse local -q "SELECT timestamp,hash,from,to,hex(rawTx) FROM 'transactions.parquet' WHERE hash='0x152065ad73bcf63f68572f478e2dc6e826f1f434cb488b993e5956e6b7425eed';"

# show the schema
$ clickhouse local -q "DESCRIBE TABLE 'transactions.parquet';"
timestamp       Nullable(DateTime64(3))
hash    Nullable(String)
chainId Nullable(String)
from    Nullable(String)
to      Nullable(String)
value   Nullable(String)
nonce   Nullable(String)
gas     Nullable(String)
gasPrice        Nullable(String)
gasTipCap       Nullable(String)
gasFeeCap       Nullable(String)
dataSize        Nullable(Int64)
data4Bytes      Nullable(String)
sources Array(Nullable(String))
includedAtBlockHeight   Nullable(Int64)
includedBlockTimestamp  Nullable(DateTime64(3))
inclusionDelayMs        Nullable(Int64)
rawTx   Nullable(String)

# get exclusive transactions from bloxroute
clickhouse local -q "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 'transactions.parquet' WHERE length(sources) == 1 AND sources[1] == 'bloxroute';"

# get count of landed vs not-landed exclusive transactions, by source
clickhouse local -q "WITH includedBlockTimestamp!=0 as included SELECT sources[1], included, count(included) FROM 'out/out/transactions.parquet' WHERE length(sources) == 1 GROUP BY sources[1], included;"
```

## Interesting analyses

- Amount of transactions which eventually lands on chain + inclusionDelay (by source)
- Transaction quality (i.e. for high-volume XOF sources)
- Trash transactions

Feel free to continue the conversation in the [Flashbots Forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/mempool-dumpster-a-free-mempool-transaction-archive/2401)!

## Running the analyzer

You can easily run the included analyzer to create summaries like [2023-09-22_summary.txt](https://mempool-dumpster.flashbots.net/ethereum/mainnet/2023-09/2023-09-22_summary.txt):

1. First, download the parquet and sourcelog files from https://mempool-dumpster.flashbots.net/ethereum/mainnet/2023-09
2. Then run the analyzer:

```bash
go run cmd/analyze/* \
    --out summary.txt \
    --input-parquet /mnt/data/mempool-dumpster/2023-09-22/2023-09-22.parquet \
    --input-sourcelog /mnt/data/mempool-dumpster/2023-09-22/2023-09-22_sourcelog.csv.zip
```

# System architecture

1. [Collector](cmd/collect/main.go): Connects to EL nodes and writes new mempool transactions and sourcelog to hourly CSV files. Multiple collector instances can run without colliding.
2. [Merger](cmd/merge/main.go): Takes collector CSV files as input, de-duplicates, checks transaction inclusion status, sorts by timestamp and writes output files (Parquet, CSV and Summary).
3. [Analyzer](cmd/analyze/main.go): Analyzes sourcelog CSV files and produces summary report.
4. [Website](cmd/website/main.go): Website dev-mode as well as build + upload.

# Getting started

## Mempool Collector

1. Subscribes to new pending transactions at various data sources
1. Writes 3 files:
    1. Transactions CSV: `timestamp_ms, hash, raw_tx` (one file per hour by default)
    1. Sourcelog CSV: `timestamp_ms, hash, source` (one entry for every single transaction received by any source)
    1. Trash CSV: `timestamp_ms, hash, source, reason, note` (trash transactions received by any source, these are not added to the transactions CSV. currently only if already included in previous block)
1. Note: the collector can store transactions repeatedly, and only the merger will properly deduplicate them later

**Default filenames:**

Transactions
- Schema: `<out_dir>/<date>/transactions/txs_<date>_<uid>.csv`
- Example: `out/2023-08-07/transactions/txs_2023-08-07-10-00_collector1.csv`

Sourcelog
- Schema: `<out_dir>/<date>/sourcelog/src_<date>_<uid>.csv`
- Example: `out/2023-08-07/sourcelog/src_2023-08-07-10-00_collector1.csv`

Trash
- Schema: `<out_dir>/<date>/trash/trash_<date>_<uid>.csv`
- Example: `out/2023-08-07/trash/trash_2023-08-07-10-00_collector1.csv`

**Running the mempool collector:**

```bash
# print help
go run cmd/collect/main.go -help

# Connect to ws://localhost:8546 and write CSVs into ./out
go run cmd/collect/main.go -out ./out

# Connect to multiple nodes
go run cmd/collect/main.go -out ./out -nodes ws://server1.com:8546,ws://server2.com:8546
```

## Merger

- Iterates over collector output directory / CSV files
- Deduplicates transactions, sorts them by timestamp

```bash
go run cmd/merge/main.go -h
```

# Architecture

## General design goals

- Keep it simple and stupid
- Vendor-agnostic (main flow should work on any server, independent of a cloud provider)
- Downtime-resilience to minimize any gaps in the archive
- Multiple collector instances can run concurrently, without getting into each others way
- Merger produces the final archive (based on the input of multiple collector outputs)
- The final archive:
  - Includes (1) parquet file with transaction metadata, and (2) compressed file of raw transaction CSV files
  - Compatible with [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/s3) and [S3 Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/selecting-content-from-objects.html) (Parquet using gzip compression)
  - Easily distributable as torrent

## Collector

- `NodeConnection`
    - One for each EL connection
    - New pending transactions are sent to `TxProcessor` via a channel
- `TxProcessor`
    - Check if it already processed that tx
    - Store it in the output directory

## Merger

- Uses https://github.com/xitongsys/parquet-go to write Parquet format

## Transaction RLP format

- encoding transactions in typed EIP-2718 envelopes:
  - https://medium.com/@markodayansa/a-comprehensive-guide-to-rlp-encoding-in-ethereum-6bd75c126de0
  - https://blog.mycrypto.com/new-transaction-types-on-ethereum
  - https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718

## Stats libraries

- currently using: https://github.com/HdrHistogram/hdrhistogram-go/
- possibly more versatile: https://github.com/montanaflynn/stats
