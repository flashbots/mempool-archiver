[![Goreport status](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/flashbots/mempool-dumpster)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/flashbots/mempool-dumpster)
[![Test status](https://github.com/flashbots/mempool-dumpster/workflows/Checks/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/flashbots/mempool-dumpster/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Checks%22)

Dump mempool transactions from EL nodes, and archive them in [Parquet](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format) and CSV format.

Notes:

- **The data is freely available at https://mempool-dumpster.flashbots.net**
- This project is under active development, although relatively stable and ready to use in production
- Observing about 1M - 1.5M unique transactions per day

## Available mempool sources

1. Generic EL nodes (`newPendingTransactions`) (i.e. go-ethereum, Infura, etc.)
2. Alchemy ([`alchemy_pendingTransactions`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/alchemy-pendingtransactions))
3. [bloXroute](https://docs.bloxroute.com/streams/newtxs-and-pendingtxs) (at least ["Professional" plan](https://bloxroute.com/pricing/))
4. [Chainbound Fiber](https://fiber.chainbound.io/docs/usage/getting-started/)
5. [Eden](https://docs.edennetwork.io/eden-rpc/speed-rpc)

## FAQ

- _What is a-pool?_ ... A-Pool is a regular geth node with some optimized peering settings, subscribed to over the network.
- _What are exclusive transactions?_ ... a transaction that was seen from no other source (transaction only provided by a single source)

# Working with Parquet

[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is a column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk (more [here](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet#:~:text=What%20is%20Parquet%3F,handle%20complex%20data%20in%20bulk.)).

We recommend to use [clickhouse local](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/utilities/clickhouse-local) to work with Parquet files, it makes it easy to run [queries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements) like:

```bash
# count rows
$ clickhouse local -q 'select count(*) from "transactions.parquet" limit 1;'

# get the first hash+rawTx
$ clickhouse local -q 'select hash,hex(rawTx) from "transactions.parquet" limit 1;'

# show the schema
$ clickhouse local -q 'describe table "transactions.parquet";'
timestamp	Nullable(DateTime64(3))
hash	Nullable(String)
chainId	Nullable(String)
from	Nullable(String)
to	Nullable(String)
value	Nullable(String)
nonce	Nullable(String)
gas	Nullable(String)
gasPrice	Nullable(String)
gasTipCap	Nullable(String)
gasFeeCap	Nullable(String)
dataSize	Nullable(Int64)
data4Bytes	Nullable(String)
rawTx	Nullable(String)
```

# System architecture

1. [Collector](cmd/collect/main.go): Connects to EL nodes and writes new mempool transactions and sourcelog to hourly CSV files. Multiple collector instances can run without colliding.
2. [Merger](cmd/merge/main.go): Takes collector CSV files as input, de-duplicates, sorts by timestamp and writes CSV + Parquet output files.
3. [Analyzer](cmd/analyze/main.go): Analyzes sourcelog CSV files and produces summary report.
4. [Website](cmd/website/main.go): Website dev-mode as well as build + upload.

# Getting started

## Mempool Collector

1. Subscribes to new pending transactions at various data sources
1. Writes `timestamp_ms` + `hash` + `raw_tx` to CSV file (one file per hour [by default](collector/consts.go))
1. Note: the collector can store transactions repeatedly, and only the merger will properly deduplicate them later

**Default filenames:**

Transactions
- Schema: `<out_dir>/<date>/transactions/txs_<date>_<uid>.csv`
- Example: `out/2023-08-07/transactions/txs_2023-08-07-10-00_collector1.csv`

Sourcelog
- Schema: `<out_dir>/<date>/sourcelog/src_<date>_<uid>.csv`
- Example: `out/2023-08-07/sourcelog/src_2023-08-07-10-00_collector1.csv`

**Running the mempool collector:**

```bash
# print help
go run cmd/collect/main.go -help

# Connect to ws://localhost:8546 and write CSVs into ./out
go run cmd/collect/main.go -out ./out

# Connect to multiple nodes
go run cmd/collect/main.go -out ./out -nodes ws://server1.com:8546,ws://server2.com:8546
```

## Merger

- Iterates over collector output directory / CSV files
- Deduplicates transactions, sorts them by timestamp

```bash
go run cmd/merge/main.go -h
```

# Architecture

## General design goals

- Keep it simple and stupid
- Vendor-agnostic (main flow should work on any server, independent of a cloud provider)
- Downtime-resilience to minimize any gaps in the archive
- Multiple collector instances can run concurrently, without getting into each others way
- Merger produces the final archive (based on the input of multiple collector outputs)
- The final archive:
  - Includes (1) parquet file with transaction metadata, and (2) compressed file of raw transaction CSV files
  - Compatible with [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/s3) and [S3 Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/selecting-content-from-objects.html) (Parquet using gzip compression)
  - Easily distributable as torrent

## Collector

- `NodeConnection`
    - One for each EL connection
    - New pending transactions are sent to `TxProcessor` via a channel
- `TxProcessor`
    - Check if it already processed that tx
    - Store it in the output directory

## Merger

- Uses https://github.com/xitongsys/parquet-go to write Parquet format

## Transaction RLP format

- encoding transactions in typed EIP-2718 envelopes:
